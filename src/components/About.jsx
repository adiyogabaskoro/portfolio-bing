        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I’m Adiyoga A Baskoro, or you can call me Yoga — a passionate Fresh Graduate from SMK Negeri 7 Semarang, 
            majoring in Network Information Systems and Applications (SIJA).
            I specialize in web coding and enjoy exploring new technologies to improve my technical skills.
        </p>
        <p> Beyond technology, I am an active organizational member with strong leadership and teamwork abilities. 
            My hobbies—such as exploring nature, watching films, and listening to music—have helped me develop great 
            interpersonal skills and adaptability in various situations.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am known as a friendly, diligent, and disciplined person who works well with others and always strives to achieve goals with clear objectives and direction. 
            Additionally, I was also involved in school organizations. I served as the Chairman of the Paskibra Organization for the 2024/2025 term. 
            I have also participated in several Paskibra competitions.
